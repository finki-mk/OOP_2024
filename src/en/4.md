## Auditory Exercise 4 (copy constructor, this, friend, static)

1\. Problems
----------
### 1.1. Team

Define a class Team that is described with name, year of founding and the city. Define a class Game that keeps information for the host and the guest (objects of class Team), goals scored by the host and goals scored by the guest.

Define a function rematch that as arguments accepts two objects of class Game and checks if one of them is a rematch of the other. A match is a rematch if the host of the first game is a guest in the second game, and vice versa. If the match is a rematch, return the aggregate winner of the fixture (the one that scored more goals on aggregate).

Solution:
```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    #include <cstring>
    using namespace std;
    
    class Team {
    private:
        char name[100];
        int yearFounded;
        char city[100];
    public:
        Team(const char *name = "", const int yearFounded = 0,
             const char *city = "") {
            strcpy(this->name, name);
            this->yearFounded = yearFounded;
            strcpy(this->city, city);
        }
        
        Team (const Team & t){
            strcpy(this->name, t.name);
            this->yearFounded = t.yearFounded;
            strcpy(this->city, t.city);
        }
    
        char *getName() {
            return name;
        }
    
        void print() {
            cout << name << " " << yearFounded << endl;
        }
    
    };
    
    class Game {
    private:
        Team host;
        Team guest;
        int hostGoals;
        int guestGoals;
    public:
        Game(const Team host = Team(), const Team guest = Team(),
             const int hostGoals = 0, const int guestGoals = 0) {
            this->host = host;
            this->guest = guest;
            this->hostGoals = hostGoals;
            this->guestGoals = guestGoals;
        }
    
        Team getHost() const {
            return host;
        }
        Team getGuest() const {
            return guest;
        }
    
        int getHostGoals() const {
            return hostGoals;
        }
    
        int getGuestGoals() const {
            return guestGoals;
        }
    
    };
    
    Team winner(const Game game1, const Game game2) {
        if (strcmp(game1.getHost().getName(), game2.getGuest().getName()) == 0 &&
                strcmp(game2.getHost().getName(), game1.getGuest().getName()) == 0) {
            int goalsHost = game1.getHostGoals() + game2.getGuestGoals();
            int goalsGuest = game1.getGuestGoals() + game2.getHostGoals();
            if (goalsHost >= goalsGuest) {
                return game1.getHost();
            } else {
                return game1.getGuest();
            }
        }
        return Team();
    }
    
    int main() {
        Team t1("Barcelona", 1900, "Barcelona");
        Team t2("Real Madrid", 1890, "Madrid");
        Team t3("Elche", 1950, "Elche");
        Game g1(t1, t2, 5, 0);
        Game g2(t2, t1, 2, 2);
        Game g3(t1, t3, 6, 2);
        Team w = winner(g1, g2);
        w.print();
        return 0;
    }
```
### 1.2. Library (friend)
Define a class Book that contains information about the book's title, the author's name, and its availability. For this class, all three constructors and a destructor should be defined. Then, define a class Library that is a friend of the Book class. In this class, store the name of the library (initially set to "City Library"), an array of objects of the Book class, and the number of books (initially set to 0). For this class, define a method addBook that adds a book to the array of books and a method to print all information about the library. Define a third class LibraryMember that stores information about the name and identification number for a member of the library. Provide appropriate constructors, destructors, set and get methods as needed.

Define a function checkOutBook, which is a friend of all three classes and takes a member, a library and one index as arguments. This function should update the availability when someone requests a book and print an appropriate message if the book is not available.

In the main program, create an object of the Library class, enter information for up to 30 books, and add them to the library. Then, print the information about the library. Create a library member and additionally enter the index of the book they want to borrow. Check if that book is available.

Solution:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;

class LibraryMember;

class Library;

class Book {
private:
    char title[30];
    char author[30];
    bool availability;

    friend class Library;

    friend void checkOutBook(LibraryMember &member, Library &lib, int &index);

public:
    Book(char *title = "", char *author = "", bool availability = false) {
        strcpy(this->title, title);
        strcpy(this->author, author);
        this->availability = availability;
    }

    Book(const Book &b) {
        strcpy(this->title, b.title);
        strcpy(this->author, b.author);
        this->availability = b.availability;
    }

    ~Book() {}
};

class Library {
private:
    char nameLibrary[30];
    Book books[30];
    int numberOfBooks;

    friend void checkOutBook(LibraryMember &member, Library &lib, int &index);

public:
    Library() {
        strcpy(nameLibrary, "City_Library");
        numberOfBooks = 0;
    }

    ~Library() {}

    void addBook(Book &b) {
        if (numberOfBooks < 30) {
            books[numberOfBooks++] = b;
        } else {
            cout << "Library is full." << endl;
        }
    }

    void print() {
        cout << "Library: " << nameLibrary << endl;
        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfBooks; i++) {
            cout << books[i].title << " " << books[i].author << " " << books[i].availability << endl;
        }
    }
};

class LibraryMember {
private:
    char nameMember[30];
    int id;

    friend void checkOutBook(LibraryMember &member, Library &lib, int &index);

public:
    LibraryMember(char *nameMember = "", int id = 0) {
        strcpy(this->nameMember, nameMember);
        this->id = id;
    }

    ~LibraryMember() {}

};

void checkOutBook(LibraryMember &member, Library &lib, int &index) {
    if (lib.books[index].availability) {
        cout << member.nameMember << " ID: " << member.id << " checks out " << lib.books[index].title << endl;
        lib.books[index].availability = false;
    } else {
        cout << "Sorry " << lib.books[index].title << " is not available" << endl;
    }
}

int main() {

    Library l1;
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the number of books" << endl;
    cin >> n;
    char name[30], author[30];
    bool availability;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> name >> author >> availability;
        Book b = Book(name, author, availability);
        l1.addBook(b);
    }
    l1.print();
    LibraryMember m1("Marko", 9541);
    int index;
    cin >> index;
    checkOutBook(m1, l1, index);


    return 0;
}

```
### 1.3. Students (static)
Define class Student that stores information about the student's name, ID number, and GPA. Static members should be defined to provide information about the number of students and the overall GPA. Static functions should be implemented to return the overall GPA and the number of students. Whenever an object is created, the static members should be updated.

In the main program, enter information for n students, print the list of students and the values for the static members.

Solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;

class Student {
private:
    char name[30];
    char id[10];
    float GPA;
    static int totalStudents;
    static float totalGPA;
public:
    Student() {}

    Student(char *name, char *id, float GPA) {
        strcpy(this->name, name);
        strcpy(this->id, id);
        this->GPA = GPA;
        totalStudents++;
        totalGPA += GPA;
    }

    static int getTotalStudents() {
        return totalStudents;
    }

    static float getAverageGPA() {
        return totalGPA / totalStudents;
    }

    void print() {
        cout << id << " " << name << " " << GPA << endl;
    }
};

int Student::totalStudents = 0;
float Student::totalGPA = 0.0;


int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter number of students" << endl;
    cin >> n;
    Student students[n];
    char name[30], id[10];
    float gpa;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> name >> id >> gpa;
        students[i] = Student(name, id, gpa);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        students[i].print();
    }
    cout << "Total students: " << Student::getTotalStudents() << endl;
    cout << "Total average: " << Student::getAverageGPA() << endl;
    return 0;
}

```
Additional requirement: Implement sequential generation of student IDs when they are created.
The first student has the ID 230001, then 230002, 230003...
